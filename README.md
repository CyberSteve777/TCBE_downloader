Downloader of Ryorama's addon "TerrariaCraft-Bedrock" written in Python


Thanks for Ryorama for developing this addon.
This downloader clones code from https://github.com/Ryorama/TerrariaCraft-Bedrock and makes it in one .mcaddon file.


Instructions:
1) Install Python 3.6+ and add it to PATH
2) Install requirements (you need to run command "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the same dir as main.py file, if you use IOS/Android, you can skip this step)
3) Download addon:
   1) If you are on PC, you can run both main files, but with mainPC.py you can select downloading path using GUI.
   2) If you use Android/IOS, you should run main_aori.py. Result files will be in the same dir as main_aori.py file.
4) open result .mcaddon file using Minecraft
5) Enjoy your game ;)


P.S. Some code was stolen from https://github.com/twfb/git-clone
